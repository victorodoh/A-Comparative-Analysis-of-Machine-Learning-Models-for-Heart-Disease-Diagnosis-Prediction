# A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Heart-Disease-Diagnosis-Prediction
This project compares four machine-learning models (LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Classifier, Logistic Regression) on a dataset with 18 attributes and 320,000 instances for heart disease prediction. The study aims to provide insights for developing accurate Heart Disease prediction models.

### Experiments

Model performances compared for the following scenarios:
- Unsampled data
- Oversampled data with outliers (Using SMOTE Oversampling Technique)
- Oversampled data without outliers (SMOTE)
- Oversampled data with outliers (Using ADASYN Oversampling Technique)
- Oversampled without outliers (ADASYN)
